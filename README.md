# We are A-Team

This project is meant to be exercise in good programing practices.
We are a team of two. The point is to learn to interact and create a
supperior product.


## The project

The functionality of the finished product should be generic chat app.
We've chosen to use Django as our backend and react as frontend. The 
database is sqlite3, it's accesible through REST API.
